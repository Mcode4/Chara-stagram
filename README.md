# Chara-stagram
This is the first un-editted version of my Character-stagram site made purely of HTML, CSS, and JS. This was my first big project and it took me 4 days to create and show to my class. Some things are missing and I have had a few problems I ran into which I've solved and listed below.

## Steps To Run Project
To run the site, cd to JS Folder in Char-stagram and type 'npm i && node server.js'. This should run the site on port 9999 and be avaliable to view on http://localhost:9999

Next go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ and gain temporary access. Read Errors Section to see why this is necessary

### Errors & Problems
The number 1 problem with this is the api responses and cors error to be exact. This site was mostly made to be shown and not actually used so after some research, I found a shortcut to the problem which is now Step 2 in the Steps Section

Next the project isn't complete. Posts, the main User Profile, and Settings have not being made. In the span of 4 days designing and coding this, I left out some tasks to be completed later. This version does show the main functionality and what my goal was well enough for me to present it.

Styling issues, Some elements may overlap and not be designed in the way I intended but I worked around most issues and cleaned them up to my best ability.
